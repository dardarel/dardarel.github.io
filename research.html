    MickaÃ«l's work concentrates on compilation for heterogeneous Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC), in the context of software defined radio. In this work as well as previous experiences, he developped skills in :
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Hardware design and implementation</h5>
      <p>Experiments on FPGA technology.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Compilation</h5>
      <p>Complete design and implementation of a compiler back-end for heterogeneous MPSoC.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Network</h5>
      <p>PHY layer development for CAN, SPI, 802.15.4, LTE-Advanced.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Modeling</h5>
      <p>Theory on dataflow model of computation with associated model of execution.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Application fields</h5>
      <p>Signal processing, Software Defined Radio, Cryptography.</p></li>
    </ul>
