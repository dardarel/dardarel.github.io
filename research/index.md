#### Research

MickaÃ«l's work concentrates on compilation for heterogeneous Multi-Processor
System on Chip (MPSoC), in the context of software defined radio. In this work
as well as previous experiences, he developped skills in :

##### Hardware design and implementation
- Experiments on FPGA technology.

##### Compilation
- Complete design and implementation of a compiler back-end for heterogeneous MPSoC.

##### Network
- PHY layer development for CAN, SPI, 802.15.4, LTE-Advanced.

##### Modeling
- Theory on dataflow model of computation with associated model of execution.

##### Application fields
- Signal processing, Software Defined Radio, Cryptography.
